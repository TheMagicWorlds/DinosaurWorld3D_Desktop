To prioritize magical moment features in the 3D Virtual Dinosaur World with AI bots in Unity, leverage the March 12, 2025, data for autonomous engagement as of March 13, 2025:

* **Peak Hour Emphasis**: During high-activity hours (06:00, 10:00, 17:00, 20:00), with 4 total logins and peak calls (e.g., 114 at 20:00), schedule striking magical moments—like AI dinosaurs hunting with glowing effects or paleontologists uncovering shimmering fossils—every 15-20 minutes to maximize immersion.  
* **Off-Peak Maintenance**: In low-activity times (e.g., 07:00, 0 logins), trigger subtle moments, like grazing bots with faint sparkles, every 30-45 minutes.  
* **Engagement Focus**: With only 2 unique logins, prioritize captivating, educational visuals—like narrated tours with radiant effects—to retain users.
